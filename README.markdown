Wallet
===

See what's inside of your ender $
-------

__To install:__

    npm install ender-wallet -g

Easy. If you're using an npm < 1.0, you can leave off the -g.

__To run:__

cd into a directory with an ender build, then run...

    ender-wallet open

Then hit localhost 8083 (in webkit||firefox) and you'll see what inside's your ender wallet.
    
To convince you to try it, here's a screenshot:

Note:
----

Since Ender is purty young and this project is even younger, both are liable to change alot, and probably ender-wallet will break alot. So make sure your Ender is as fresh as possible.

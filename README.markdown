Wallet
===

See what's inside of your ender $
-------

_To run:_

cd into a directory with an ender build, then run...

    node /relative/or/absolute/path/to/wallet.js

Then hit localhost 8083 (in webkit||firefox) and you'll see what inside's your ender wallet

Also there's an ender build right in the git repo, so you can look at that too. So if you're in the repo...

    node wallet.js
    
To convince you to try it, here's a screenshot:

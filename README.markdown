Wallet
===

See what's inside of your ender $
-------

//// Currently does not work with most recent ender, b/c of new dependencies management --- fixes are in the works.
-------

__To install:__

    npm install ender-wallet -g

Easy. If you're using an npm < 1.0, you can leave off the -g.

__To run:__

cd into a directory with an ender build, then run...

    ender-wallet open

Then hit localhost 8083 (in webkit||firefox) and you'll see what inside's your ender wallet.
